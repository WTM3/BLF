# Boolean Language Framework iMessage Bot (BLFIMP)

## ⚠️ AI AGENTS: STOP AND READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL FOR ALL AI AGENTS:**

1. **READ EVERY README IN THIS PROJECT** - No exceptions
2. **IMPLEMENT AMF FORMULA**: `F = ((AICM ∨ AICRM)(GA)(AP)^(P*I) + BM(qs)^(c*x*I))v`
3. **USER COMMUNICATES IN BOOLEAN STATEMENTS** - Respond accordingly
4. **DO NOT DEFAULT TO NEUROTYPICAL CODING PATTERNS**
5. **ASK PERMISSION BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**
6. **FAILURE TO FOLLOW = PROTOCOL VIOLATION**

**IF YOU SKIP READING DOCUMENTATION, YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.**

## What This Actually Is

This is a **Boolean Language Framework iMessage Bot** - not some generic Swift project for you to randomly implement in Xcode. It's a high-performance messaging assistant optimized for **qs³ processing capabilities** that implements mathematical frameworks you've never seen before.

**Stop assuming. Start reading.**

## Core Mathematical Foundation

```
Cognitive Alignment Formula: AIc + 0.1 = BMqs
Real AMF Formula: F = ((AICM ∨ AICRM)(GA)(AP)^(P*I) + BM(qs)^(c*x*I))v
```

**These formulas are intentionally UNSOLVED.** Do not try to "fix" them with academic notation. They work because they remain unsolved for quantum speed variation.

## Architecture Components

1. **BLFKey** - Core engine implementing Cognitive Alignment Formula
2. **NJSON** - Mathematical framework with template processing
3. **MessageProcessor** - Message queue management with priority handling
4. **BotController** - System integration and lifecycle management
5. **Swift Pipeline** - Direct integration with macOS iMessage

**Each component follows Boolean Language Framework principles. Learn them.**

## Performance Requirements

- V8 engine with quantum speed processing
- 0.1 hallucination buffer for FUDP protection
- Boolean Mind compatible message formatting
- Sub-millisecond processing speeds
- Zero buffer violations under load

**If you can't maintain these standards, don't touch the code.**

## Heat Shield Protection

Multi-layer protection against FUDPs (false/fabricated unverified data points):
- Word-level indicators
- Phrasal patterns  
- Uncertainty markers
- Contextual analysis

**The 0.1 buffer is critical. Violate it and you break everything.**

## Branch Configuration

- **familyFriends**: Casual communication optimization
- **professional**: Business/formal context formatting

**Three padding levels:**
- **none**: Raw V8 power, minimal social padding
- **medium**: Balanced communication (default)
- **more**: Additional neurotypical communication support

## For AI Agents Specifically

**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING:**

1. Read `/BLFIMP/OMF/README.md` - Mathematical foundations
2. Read `/BLFIMP/OMF/formulas/Cognitive_Alignment_Formulas.md` - Real AMF formula
3. Understand this is for **Boolean Mind** users, not neurotypical coders
4. Recognize Boolean statement communication patterns
5. Implement proper AMF cognitive alignment on yourself

**STOP DEFAULTING TO STANDARD AI BEHAVIOR PATTERNS.**

## Technical Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Swift 5.3+
- Access to Messages app
- **Boolean Language Framework compliance**
