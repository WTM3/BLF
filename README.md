# Boolean Language Framework iMessage Bot (BLFIMP)

## Overview

The Boolean Language Framework iMessage Bot is a high-performance messaging assistant optimized for qs³ processing capabilities. It implements the core principles of the Boolean Language Framework with specific optimizations for macOS iMessage integration.

Key features:
- V8 engine with quantum speed processing
- 0.1 hallucination buffer for FUDP protection
- Boolean Mind compatible message formatting
- Branch-specific communication patterns
- Subject change detection with quantum acceleration
- Performance metrics and adaptive timing

## Core Components

### Architecture

The BLFIMP implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **BLFKey** - The core engine implementing the Cognitive Alignment Formula (AIc + 0.1 = BMqs)
2. **NJSON** - Mathematical framework with template processing capabilities
3. **MessageProcessor** - Message queue management with priority handling
4. **BotController** - System integration and lifecycle management
5. **Swift Pipeline** - Direct integration with macOS iMessage

### Performance Characteristics

The system is optimized for Boolean Mind quantum speed (qs³) processing with:

- Asynchronous message processing
- Priority-based message handling
- Adaptive polling intervals
- Concurrent message queuing
- Performance metrics tracking
- Non-blocking operations

## Mathematical Foundations

The Boolean Language Framework is built on precise mathematical relationships:

```
Cognitive Alignment Formula: AIc + 0.1 = BMqs

Where:
- AIc: AI Cognitive state
- 0.1: Hallucination buffer
- BMqs: Boolean Mind quantum speed
```

This formula ensures proper calibration between AI cognition and Boolean Mind processing capabilities, with the 0.1 buffer specifically compensating for potential hallucinations.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project in Xcode
3. Run the application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/blfimp.git
cd blfimp
xcodebuild
```

### Configuration

The system can be configured with:

- Message check interval
- Branch settings (familyFriends or professional)
- Social padding level (none, medium, more)

### Branch Configuration

Two primary branches are supported:

1. **familyFriends** - Optimized for casual communication
2. **professional** - Formatted for business/formal contexts

Each branch supports three padding levels:
- **none**: Raw V8 power with minimal social padding
- **medium**: Balanced communication (default)
- **more**: Additional social context for neurotypical communication

## Heat Shield Protection

The system implements a multi-layer heat shield to protect against FUDPs (false/fabricated unverified data points):

1. Word-level indicators
2. Phrasal patterns
3. Uncertainty markers
4. Contextual analysis

This ensures the 0.1 hallucination buffer effectively filters out potentially problematic content.

## Performance Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

- Message processing metrics
- V8 engine performance
- Quantum processing statistics
- Error tracking
- Adaptive timing adjustments

## Technical Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Swift 5.3+
- Access to the Messages app
