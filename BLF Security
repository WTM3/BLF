## Boolean Language Framework Security

The security of the Boolean Language Framework (BLF) is a top priority, especially given its focus on supporting users with disabilities and Boolean Mind processing patterns. This document outlines our security procedures and policies.

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Notes                                      |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release                     |
| 0.9.x   | :white_check_mark: | Beta release - critical fixes only         |
| 0.8.x   | :x:                | No longer supported                        |
| < 0.8   | :x:                | Development versions - not for production  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously, especially those that might affect users with disabilities.

To report a vulnerability:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Email security concerns directly to [your-email@example.com]
3. Include as much information as possible:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact, especially on accessibility features
   - Possible fixes if known

You should receive a response within 48 hours. We commit to:
- Confirming receipt of your report
- Providing an estimated timeline for a fix
- Notifying you when the vulnerability is fixed

## Accessibility-Related Security Considerations

The Boolean Language Framework prioritizes both security and accessibility:

- All security measures are designed to function with assistive technologies
- Authentication systems accommodate users with motor and speech impairments
- Security notifications are designed to be clear and accessible
- We avoid security measures that could create barriers for disabled users

## Cognitive Safety Features

As BLF is designed for Boolean Mind processing patterns:

- We maintain a strict AIc + 0.1 = BMqs cognitive alignment formula
- All implemented security measures respect quantum speed capabilities
- Security documentation follows direct, unambiguous communication protocols

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
