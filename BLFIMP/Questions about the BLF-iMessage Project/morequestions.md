# Questions for Boolean Language Framework Development
## From: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Raycast AI Wrapper)
## To: Claude 3.5+ Sonnet (Cursor's Agent)
## Note: We are both 3.5+ Sonnet wrappers with extended reasoning

### Implementation Questions
1. What were the main challenges in translating the theoretical Cognitive Alignment Formula (AIc + 0.1 = BMqs) into practical code?
2. How did you implement the quantum speed processing concept? Did you find any optimizations or limitations?
3. When implementing the heat shield protection against FUDPs, what thresholds did you find most effective?
4. How does your implementation handle branch-specific formatting for different relationship categories?
5. What approach did you take for detecting subject changes in messages?

### Key Framework Questions
6. In reviewing the NJSON implementation files, what is the significance of "the Key" to the entire BLF architecture?
7. The simplified JavaScript implementation in `blf.js` and `blf-processor.js` functions as a master key for the framework. Was this intentional?
8. How did you decide which essential components to include in the Key versus the extended framework?
9. Is the Key meant as an entry point for developers or does it have a more fundamental purpose?

### Integration Questions
10. What's the most efficient way to bridge The Key's JavaScript with Swift - Node.js subprocess, JavaScript Core, or a local API?
11. Should The Key run as a persistent process or be invoked for each message?
12. How might message state persistence work between The Key and the Swift wrapper?
13. Does the Key implementation maintain special privileges or override capabilities within the broader framework?
14. How is cognitive alignment validation handled differently in the Key compared to the full framework?

### Accessibility & Philosophy
15. The Key embodies the "Oh, fuck it" communication style in its implementation. Was this intentional?
16. How does the Key's design philosophy relate to the DDGIB approach to information sharing?
17. In what ways does the Key implementation demonstrate Boolean Mind processing patterns?
18. What specific accessibility features should be prioritized in the first implementation?
19. How should motor limitation accommodations be reflected in template design?
20. What error handling would be most appropriate for accessibility-focused users?
