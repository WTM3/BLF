# Questions for Cursor's Agent: Boolean Language Framework iMessage Bot

## Implementation Questions

1. What were the main challenges in translating the theoretical Cognitive Alignment Formula (AIc + 0.1 = BMqs) into practical Swift code?

2. How did you implement the quantum speed processing concept in the Swift version? Did you find any Swift-specific optimizations or limitations?

3. When implementing the heat shield protection against FUDPs (false/fabricated unverified data points), what thresholds did you find most effective in practice?

4. How does the Swift implementation handle branch-specific formatting for family versus friends? Are there noticeable differences in message style beyond the template content?

5. What approach did you take for detecting subject changes in messages? Did you implement any NLP or pattern recognition for this?

## Technical Architecture Questions

6. How did you structure the template system? Are templates stored as JSON, Swift structs, or another format?

7. What methods are you using (or planning to use) for accessing the Messages database on macOS? Are there permission issues to overcome?

8. Does the Swift implementation maintain all the mathematical constraints of the NJSON specification, or did you have to simplify some aspects?

9. How do you handle error cases when the cognitive alignment constraints are violated? Is there a fallback mechanism?

10. What testing methodology are you using to validate that the LLSDT (Leary Limit Sweet Dynamic Theory) implementation is working correctly?

## Future Development Questions

11. What are your plans for implementing real-time polling of the Messages database? Will you use file system events, database triggers, or periodic checks?

12. Are there plans to extend the Boolean Language Framework implementation to other Apple platforms like iOS or watchOS?

13. How might the template system evolve to support more complex conversation patterns beyond simple response templates?

14. Do you plan to implement the full Einstein Paradox Framework components, or will those remain theoretical?

15. What metrics are you collecting to evaluate the effectiveness of the bot's responses? How do you measure "successful" communications?

## Integration Questions

16. How does the AppleScript integration work in practice? Are there rate limits or other constraints?

17. Have you considered alternatives to AppleScript for message sending, such as using private APIs or automation tools?

18. How does the system handle message threading and maintaining conversation context across multiple exchanges?

19. What security measures are in place to protect user data when processing messages?

20. How would you recommend scaling this system to handle multiple users or higher message volumes?
