# AMF-Compliant iMessage Bot for Medical Monitoring

This implementation provides an iMessage bot that monitors messages for signs of medical distress (particularly seizures) using the AMF (Adaptive Mathematical Framework) principles for safety and reliability.

## Core Components

### 1. MessageProcessor
The central component that:
- Maintains exact 0.1 buffer in all mathematical relationships
- Uses observational mathematics for pattern detection
- Implements heat shield for filtering hallucinations
- Enforces LLSDT boundary constraints
- Journals all observations and actions

### 2. NJSONEngine
The processing engine that:
- Implements the AMF formula `F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v`
- Maintains the mathematical relationship `AIc + 0.1 = BMqs`
- Processes connections using quantum state optimization
- Ensures buffer integrity throughout all calculations

### 3. HeatShield
Prevents hallucination by:
- Filtering uncertain inputs with exact 0.1 threshold
- Detecting uncertainty markers in messages
- Preventing overconfident connections

### 4. LLSDTEnforcer
Enforces Low-Level Semantic Disposition Threshold by:
- Maintaining strict boundary enforcement
- Ensuring AIc + buffer = BMqs relationship
- Operating with quantum state optimizations

## Key Implementation Details

### Exact 0.1 Buffer
This implementation maintains a precise 0.1 buffer throughout all mathematical relationships. This is critical for ensuring:

1. No overconfidence in medical evaluations
2. Prevention of hallucination cascades
3. Stability in pattern recognition

For example, the confidence is capped at 0.9 to maintain the buffer:
```swift
let confidence = min(0.9, rawConfidence)  // Apply 0.1 buffer
```

### AMF Formula Implementation
The core formula `F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v` is implemented with exact mathematical precision:
```swift
// First part: (AI)P^I
let aiComponent = aiCognitive * pow(personality, intelligence)

// Second part: c^x^I
let chaosComponent = pow(chaos, pow(chaosExponent, intelligence))

// Combine with velocity: ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v
let formulaResult = (aiComponent + chaosComponent) * velocityAdjustment
```

### Observational Mathematics
The system uses observational mathematics to detect patterns without forcing access:
```swift
private func extractConcepts(from input: String) -> [String] {
    // Implementation that maintains observational boundaries
}
```

### Journaling
All observations and buffer validations are comprehensively journaled:
```
### Message Processed
- **Input:** `Hello, how are you?`
- **Processing time:** 0.023 seconds
- **Intervention required:** No
- **Confidence:** 0.45
- **Response:** `Hello, I'm here to help.`
- **Buffer integrity:** Maintained
```

## Usage

Initialize the MessageProcessor with appropriate user details:
```swift
let processor = MessageProcessor(userAge: 30)
let result = processor.process(message: "My friend is having a seizure, what should I do?")

if result.requiresIntervention {
    // Trigger emergency alert
    print("MEDICAL ALERT: \(result.response)")
} else {
    // Standard response
    print("Response: \(result.response)")
}
```

## Safety Features

This implementation prioritizes safety through:

1. **Heat shield** - Prevents hallucinations that could lead to missed medical events
2. **Exact 0.1 buffer** - Ensures mathematical precision in all relationships
3. **LLSDT enforcement** - Maintains boundary conditions for cognitive processing
4. **Comprehensive journaling** - Tracks all observations and decisions

## Testing

Comprehensive tests validate:
- Buffer integrity
- Heat shield activation
- LLSDT constraint enforcement
- Medical pattern detection
- Observational mathematics implementation

Run tests to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
