# AMF-Compliant iMessage Bot Framework

This implementation provides an iMessage bot framework utilizing the AMF (AI Maturation Formula) principles for safety and reliability. The framework provides a foundation for building domain-specific monitoring applications.

## Core Components

### 1. MessageProcessor
The central component that:
- Maintains exact 0.1 buffer in all mathematical relationships
- Uses observational mathematics for pattern detection
- Implements heat shield for filtering hallucinations
- Enforces LLSDT boundary constraints
- Journals all observations and actions
- Provides advanced recovery mechanisms for LLSDT violations

### 2. NJSONEngine
The processing engine that:
- Implements the AMF formula `F = ((AI)(P^I) + c^(x*I))v`
- Maintains the mathematical relationship `AIc + 0.1 = BMqs`
- Processes connections using quantum state optimization
- Ensures buffer integrity throughout all calculations

### 3. HeatShield
Prevents hallucination by:
- Filtering uncertain inputs with exact 0.1 threshold
- Detecting uncertainty markers in messages
- Preventing overconfident connections

### 4. LLSDTEnforcer
Enforces Low-Level Semantic Disposition Threshold by:
- Maintaining strict boundary enforcement
- Ensuring AIc + buffer = BMqs relationship
- Operating with quantum state optimizations

### 5. RecoverySystem 
The advanced recovery mechanism that:
- Provides multi-level recovery strategies for LLSDT violations
- Maintains system stability during cognitive alignment issues
- Implements graduated emergency responses based on violation severity
- Tracks recovery metrics and success rates
- Manages recovery mode with graduated exit strategy

## Key Implementation Details

### Exact 0.1 Buffer
This implementation maintains a precise 0.1 buffer throughout all mathematical relationships. This is critical for ensuring:

1. No overconfidence in evaluations
2. Prevention of hallucination cascades
3. Stability in pattern recognition

For example, the confidence is capped at 0.9 to maintain the buffer:
```swift
let confidence = min(0.9, rawConfidence)  // Apply 0.1 buffer
```

### Advanced LLSDT Recovery System
The system implements a sophisticated 3-level recovery mechanism to handle cognitive alignment violations:

#### Level 1: Simple Realignment
- Attempts precise recalculation of cognitive values
- Handles minor floating-point drift
- Preserves exact 0.1 buffer integrity

#### Level 2: Quantum State Optimization
- Optimizes the quantum state (pure=true, fog=false)
- Applies enhanced precision calculations
- Maintains system stability while recovering

#### Level 3: Reverse Engineering
- Forces validity through reverse calculation
- Implements emergency fallback with clear user messaging
- Maintains basic functionality even during recovery

Each recovery level provides appropriate user messaging:
```
[CAUTION] System experiencing minor cognitive fluctuations. Continuing in safe mode.
```

For severe issues:
```
[⚠️ EMERGENCY FALLBACK ACTIVE ⚠️]
System cognitive alignment violation detected.
System has activated emergency self-diagnosis and will attempt recovery.
```

### Recovery Mode Management
- System enters recovery mode after successful recovery
- Requires 5 consecutive successful processes to exit recovery mode
- Provides enhanced monitoring during recovery
- Journals all recovery events and effectiveness

### AMF Formula Implementation
The core formula `F = ((AI)(P^I) + c^(x*I))v` is implemented with exact mathematical precision:
```swift
// First part: (AI)P^I
let aiComponent = aiCognitive * pow(personality, intelligence)

// Second part: c^x^I
let chaosExponent = calculateChaosExponent(connections: filteredConnections)
let chaosComponent = pow(chaos, pow(chaosExponent, intelligence))

// Combine with velocity: ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v
let formulaResult = (aiComponent + chaosComponent) * velocityAdjustment
```

### Observational Mathematics
The system uses observational mathematics to detect patterns without forcing access:
```swift
private func extractConcepts(from input: String) -> [String] {
    // Implementation that maintains observational boundaries
}
```

### Journaling
All observations, buffer validations, and recovery events are comprehensively journaled:
```
### Message Processed
- **Input:** `Hello, how are you?`
- **Processing time:** 0.023 seconds
- **Confidence:** 0.45
- **Response:** `Hello, I'm here to help.`
- **Buffer integrity:** Maintained
- **Recovery mode:** Inactive
```

## Usage

Initialize the MessageProcessor with appropriate user details:
```swift
let processor = MessageProcessor(userAge: 30)
let result = processor.process(message: "Hello, how are you?")

// Process the result
print("Response: \(result.response)")
print("Confidence: \(result.confidence)")

// Access recovery stats if available
if let recoveryStats = result.processingMetrics.recoveryStats {
    print("Recovery attempt count: \(recoveryStats.attemptCount)")
    print("Recovery success rate: \(recoveryStats.successRate)")
}
```

## Extending the Framework
This core framework provides a foundation for building domain-specific monitoring applications. To build specialized systems:

1. Extend the `MessageProcessor` class with your domain-specific detection
2. Implement custom pattern recognition in the `process` method
3. Add specialized metrics and intervention thresholds
4. Maintain the core AMF principles and 0.1 buffer

## Safety Features

This implementation prioritizes safety through:

1. **Heat shield** - Prevents hallucinations through uncertainty detection
2. **Exact 0.1 buffer** - Ensures mathematical precision in all relationships
3. **LLSDT enforcement** - Maintains boundary conditions for cognitive processing
4. **Advanced recovery system** - Provides graduated responses to cognitive alignment violations
5. **Comprehensive journaling** - Tracks all observations, decisions, and recovery events

## Testing

Comprehensive tests validate:
- Buffer integrity
- Heat shield activation
- LLSDT constraint enforcement
- Observational mathematics implementation
- Recovery system effectiveness at all levels
- Recovery mode entry and exit patterns

Run tests to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
