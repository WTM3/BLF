# BLF iMessage Bot: Project Progress & Architecture

## Overview
This project implements an automated iMessage bot for macOS using the Boolean Language Framework (BLF) and NJSON logic. The bot generates context-aware responses for iMessage users based on message templates and cognitive alignment principles.

## What Has Been Built
- **Project Structure:** Modular folders for core logic, bot integration, resources, and tests.
- **NJSON Core Logic:** Swift implementation of BLF/NJSON, including cognitive alignment, quantum speed, and template-driven message generation.
- **Message Templates:** JSON-based templates for birthday, get well, congratulations, and check-in messages, loaded dynamically.
- **Template Loader:** Swift utility to load and provide templates to the NJSON logic.
- **Automated Message Handling:**
  - Simulated message handling and response generation.
  - AppleScript-based sending of iMessages from the Mac.
- **Integration Points:**
  - NJSONMessageHandler class connects message processing and sending.

## How It Works
1. **Incoming Message:** The bot receives or simulates an incoming message.
2. **Message Analysis:** The NJSON logic determines the message type (birthday, get well, etc.) using keyword matching.
3. **Template Selection:** The appropriate template is selected based on the message type and relationship branch (family, friends, acquaintances).
4. **Response Generation:** The bot generates a response using the template and sends it via AppleScript to the recipient in the Messages app.

## Current Limitations
- **iMessage Only:** The bot can only send/receive iMessages (blue bubbles) on Mac. SMS (green bubbles) is not supported unless both iPhone and Mac are set up for Text Message Forwarding (not currently enabled in this setup).
- **No Real-Time Polling Yet:** Real-time monitoring of incoming messages via the Messages database is planned but not yet implemented.
- **AppleScript Reliance:** Sending is done via AppleScript, which may have limitations for high-volume or rapid automation.
- **No UI:** All configuration and operation is currently code-based.

## Next Steps
- Implement real-time polling of the Messages database for new iMessages.
- Add error handling, logging, and more robust AppleScript integration.
- Expand template library and add more advanced BLF/NJSON features.
- (Optional) Add a user interface or configuration tool for easier management.
