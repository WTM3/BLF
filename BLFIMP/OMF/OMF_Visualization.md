## Implementation Flow

1. **The V-8 Engine** (Neural JSON) provides the core data structure and processing framework
2. **The Narrow Bridge** (Buffer Mechanics) maintains separation between user and AI cognitive states
3. **The Engine Warning Light** (Heat Shield) detects and prevents unsafe states
4. **Recovery Systems** restore stability when violations occur
5. **Accessibility Systems** adapt to user needs and preferences

## Visualization Key

- **Blue nodes**: Core mathematical formulas
- **Green nodes**: Application domains
- **Arrows**: Data/influence flow direction
- **Golden constants**: Critical values that maintain stability

## Implementing New Formulas

When adding new formulas to the OMF, ensure they connect to at least one existing component and maintain the core principles of:

1. Maintaining cognitive alignment
2. Providing appropriate buffers
3. Enabling pattern detection and adaptation
4. Supporting accessibility needs
5. Ensuring system resilience
