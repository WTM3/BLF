# Accessibility Applications of OMF

## Core Formulas

### Speech Recognition Adjustment
```
SRA = SR Ã— (1 + (AP Ã— 0.5))
```

Where:
- SRA = Adjusted Speech Recognition Time
- SR = Standard Recognition Time (typically 5 seconds)
- AP = Accessibility Pattern Factor (0.0-1.0)
- 0.5 = Adjustment Strength

### Adaptive Response Formatting
```
ACC(response) = F(response, AP, UP)
```

Where:
- ACC = Accessibility-enhanced content
- F = Transformation function
- AP = Accessibility Pattern
- UP = User Preference

## Implementation Status: ðŸ”„ In Progress

Accessibility applications are partially implemented through the AccessibilityPatternDetector in NJSON.swift, which enables adaptive responses based on detected accessibility needs.

## Practical Applications

1. **Accessibility Pattern Detection**
   - Identifies potential accessibility needs from conversation patterns
   - Recognizes specific keywords related to disabilities
   - Stores and reinforces detected patterns across sessions

2. **Adaptive Response Formatting**
   - Simplifies language for cognitive accessibility needs
   - Enhances structure for screen readers and assistive technologies
   - Adjusts timing and interaction patterns for motor control issues

3. **Personalized Accessibility Profiles**
   - Builds user-specific accessibility preferences over time
   - Applies appropriate accommodations automatically
   - Maintains accessibility context across interactions

4. **Speech Recognition Accommodation**
   - Extends recognition windows for speech impediments
   - Reduces time pressure indicators
   - Provides alternative input methods when needed

## Example Implementation

```swift
// Pattern detection
let accessibilityKeywords = [
    "dyslexia", "autism", "adhd", "hearing", "vision", "blind", 
    "deaf", "slow reader", "cognitive", "memory", "speech", 
    "stutter", "wheelchair", "mobility", "colorblind", 
    "assistive", "screen reader", "large text", "caption", 
    "subtitles", "simple language", "plain language"
]

// Response adaptation based on pattern
if senderAccessibility[sender] == "dyslexia" {
    response = formatAccessibleResponse(response, for: "dyslexia")
} else if senderAccessibility[sender] == "hearing" {
    response = formatAccessibleResponse(response, for: "hearing")
}
```

## Research Foundations

These applications build on principles from:
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- Universal Design principles
- Assistive technology research
- Cognitive load theory
- Speech recognition accessibility studies
