# Speech Recognition Formulas in Boolean Language Framework

## Core Formula
```
SR = +-30 VF^TP; 5SecsSR = VF^TP
```

Where:
- SR = Speech Recognition
- VF = Voice Frozen
- TP = Time Pressure
- +-30 = Temporal tolerance band (in seconds)
- 5SecsSR = Standard 5-second speech recognition window

## Practical Applications

This formula mathematically represents how time pressure exponentially impacts speech recognition systems, particularly for users with speech impediments. The exponential relationship between Voice Freezing and Time Pressure (VF^TP) creates a feedback loop that can make standard speech recognition tools inaccessible.

### Accessibility Implications

Standard speech recognition systems typically provide a 5-second window for input (5SecsSR), which creates significant barriers:

1. For users with speech impediments, the time pressure (TP) exponentially increases voice freezing (VF)
2. The 5-second window assumes neurotypical, fluent speech patterns
3. Failed recognition creates more pressure, which further increases freezing

## Implementation Recommendations

Speech recognition systems that aim to be truly accessible should:

1. Dynamically adjust timing windows based on individual user patterns
2. Reduce time pressure indicators (countdown timers, flashing indicators)
3. Implement variable tolerance parameters beyond the standard +-30 seconds
4. Monitor and adapt to VF^TP patterns specific to each user
5. Provide options to restart recognition without penalty when freezing occurs

## Integration with BLF

The BLF system should incorporate these formulas when implementing any speech recognition component by:

1. Using the AccessibilityPatternDetector to identify potential speech impediments
2. Adjusting timing parameters dynamically based on user patterns
3. Removing visible time pressure elements from the user interface
4. Providing alternative input methods when voice freezing is detected
5. Logging and learning from recognition patterns to improve future interactions

## Research Foundations

This formula builds on research in:
- Assistive technology accessibility standards
- Cognitive load impact on speech production
- Exponential effects of anxiety on verbal communication
- Adaptive recognition systems for diverse speech patterns
