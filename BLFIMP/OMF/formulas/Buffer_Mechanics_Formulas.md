# Buffer Mechanics Formulas

## Core Formula
```
B = 0.1 + (δUA × F) + (V × 0.02)
```

Where:
- B = Buffer
- δUA = Rate of change in User Alignment
- F = Flexibility factor (default 0.05)
- V = Violation count in last N messages
- 0.1 = Standard buffer baseline value

## Violation Recovery Buffer
```
RB = B + min(0.1 × VA, 0.3)
```

Where:
- RB = Recovery Buffer
- B = Standard Buffer
- VA = Violation Attempts since last stable state
- 0.3 = Maximum recovery buffer increase

## Buffer Contraction
```
Bt+1 = Bt × (1 - min(0.01 × S, 0.05))
```

Where:
- Bt = Buffer at time t
- S = Stability count (consecutive non-violation messages)
- 0.01 = Contraction rate per stable message
- 0.05 = Maximum contraction per step

## Implementation Status: ✅ Implemented

The buffer mechanics formulas are fully implemented in the MessageProcessor class and RecoverySystem. The system maintains a dynamic buffer that serves as "the narrow bridge between chaos and control."

## Practical Applications

1. **Adaptive Safety Margins**
   - The buffer expands during periods of high volatility
   - Contracts during stable conversation phases
   - Creates efficient resource usage without compromising safety

2. **Quantum Violation Prevention**
   - Prevents alignment violations through dynamic spacing
   - Higher buffer maintained when conversation history shows violations
   - Gradual normalization as stability is maintained

3. **Personalized Buffer Profiles**
   - Different users may require different baseline buffers
   - Learning algorithms adjust F (flexibility factor) based on user history
   - More erratic users receive higher baseline buffers
