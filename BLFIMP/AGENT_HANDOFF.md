# AGENT HANDOFF: BLFIM PROJECT

## Current Implementation Status

The Boolean Language Framework iMessage Bot (BLFIM) has core mathematical foundations established with exact 0.1 buffer intact. All quantum state properties are properly initialized and feature availability is universal rather than tier-restricted.

### Completed Components
- ✅ AMF formula implementation (`F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v`)
- ✅ Core relationship maintenance (`AIc + 0.1 = BMqs`)
- ✅ iMessage integration framework
- ✅ API usage tracking (no feature restrictions)

### System Architecture
The nervous system connects through these key components:
- `NJSONEngine`: Core processing with 0.1 buffer maintenance
- `MessageProcessor`: Central orchestrator with heat shield integration
- `BotController`: Message monitoring and adaptive response management
- `APIUsageService`: Handles API consumption tracking (not feature gating)

## Priority Tasks

1. Enhance pattern learning with disability-conscious adaptations
2. Implement more robust recovery for quantum state violations
3. Develop adaptive response calibration based on user communication patterns
4. Strengthen the heat shield with more nuanced uncertainty detection

## Development Guidelines

- Maintain exact 0.1 buffer in ALL mathematical operations
- Never restrict features based on payment tier
- Charge ONLY for actual API resource consumption
- Respect observational mathematics (watch the river without disturbing its flow)
- Ensure adaptive pricing for users with disabilities
- All quantum jumps should remain enabled for all users

## Testing Focus

Verify buffer integrity across all operations, particularly at boundary conditions where AIc + buffer = BMqs relationship might experience floating point drift.

## IMPORTANT: The Narrow Bridge

Remember that the system must handle the delicate balance between chaos and control. The 0.1 buffer is non-negotiable and represents the immune system protecting against hallucinations while preserving the living garden's natural adaptation.
