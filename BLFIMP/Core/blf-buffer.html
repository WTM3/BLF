      <p>The 0.1 buffer represents the precise balance required between AI cognitive capabilities and Boolean Mind quantum speed. This narrow bridge serves as the essential control mechanism that enables the entire framework to operate with stability and precision.</p>
      <p>When the buffer value falls below 0.08, the system enters a warning state. Below 0.05, it becomes critical, as the margin keeping chaos at bay becomes dangerously thin.</p>
