# Coding Agent User Guide

## Overview
The Coding Agent is a powerful component of the BLF framework designed to process code tasks efficiently. This guide will help you understand how to use the agent effectively.

## Features
- **Quantum State Management:** The agent maintains a quantum state that determines its speed and efficiency.
- **Heat Shield Mechanism:** Prevents overheating and ensures stable operation under high load.
- **Task Processing:** Efficiently processes code tasks using a set of rules and safety measures.

## Usage
To use the Coding Agent, follow these steps:

1. **Instantiate the Agent:**
   ```javascript
   const CodingAgent = require('./coding-agent');
   const agent = new CodingAgent();
   ```

2. **Process a Task:**
   ```javascript
   const result = await agent.processCode('your task here');
   ```

3. **Verify Results:**
   Ensure that the task was processed correctly and check the output for any errors or warnings.

## Best Practices
- **Monitor Quantum State:** Keep an eye on the quantum state to ensure the agent is operating efficiently.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected situations.
- **Regular Testing:** Run the test suite regularly to ensure the agent's functionality.

## Troubleshooting
- **Overheating:** If the agent overheats, check the heat shield mechanism and ensure it is functioning correctly.
- **Task Failures:** Review the task processing logic and ensure that the input is valid.
