# Coding Agent

## Overview
The Coding Agent is a component of the BLF framework designed to process code tasks efficiently. It uses a set of rules to manage its internal state and ensure stable operation.

## Features
- **Task Processing:** The agent processes code tasks, applying safety measures to ensure stable operation.
- **State Management:** It maintains an internal state that is adjusted based on the tasks it processes.
- **Safety Measures:** The agent includes a heat shield mechanism to prevent overheating and ensure stable operation.

## Usage
To use the Coding Agent, instantiate it and call the `processCode` method with a task:

```javascript
const CodingAgent = require('./coding-agent');
const agent = new CodingAgent();
const result = await agent.processCode('your task here');
```

## Testing
The Coding Agent includes a suite of tests to ensure its functionality. Run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Important Note
The #1 thing to understand is the `AMF.js` file, which contains the core logic and formulas used by the Coding Agent. Familiarize yourself with this file to fully grasp how the agent operates.
