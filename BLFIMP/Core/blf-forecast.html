      <p>The buffer forecast system analyzes patterns in buffer deterioration before they manifest as problems. The current analysis shows:</p>
      
      
      <p>A normal breathing pattern has been detected with cycle length of 6 time units and amplitude of 0.008. The buffer is currently in the rising phase of the cycle.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Based on current trends, no buffer violations are predicted in the forecast window. The buffer is expected to maintain integrity within acceptable parameters.</p>
