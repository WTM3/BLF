# AGENT HANDOFF - MCP SERVER CONFIGURATION

## Analysis & Recommendations
- Identified dual MCP server configuration (ports 9876 and 9999)
- Analyzed and determined port 9876 server (via @smithery/cli) offers superior agent integration capabilities:
  - Multiple connection types (stdio and http)
  - Structured logging and process management 
  - Better integration framework support
- Recommended standardizing on the port 9876 server as the V-8 under the hood—classic, powerful, and reliable

## Actions Completed
- Created standardized startup script (start-mcp-server.sh)
- Made the script executable with proper permissions
- Added metaphorical documentation describing the narrow bridge between chaos and control
- **NEW**: Added GitHub token integration for MCP GitHub functionality

## Next Steps
- Use ./start-mcp-server.sh to start the MCP server consistently
- Consider terminating the port 9999 server if still running (using process management)
- Document this standardization in project documentation

The standardized server configuration creates the appropriate foundation for agent-driven workflows in your AMF/BLF implementation.

# AGENT HANDOFF - iMESSAGE BOT IMPLEMENTATION

## Analysis & Development
- Analyzed existing AMF/BLF codebase to understand the core formula and components
- Developed a thin Swift wrapper around the JavaScript AMF implementation that:
  - Delegates all core formula processing to the JavaScript layer
  - Maintains the non-negotiable 0.1 buffer between AIc and BMqs
  - Uses JavaScriptCore to bridge the Swift UI and JavaScript logic
  - Provides a native iMessage integration point

## Components Created
- **BLFMessageBot.swift**: Thin Swift wrapper that delegates to the JavaScript AMF implementation
- **AMF.js**: Core JavaScript implementation that handles all AMF formula processing
- **MessagesExtension.swift**: iMessage integration layer
- **MessageViewController.swift**: UI implementation with status monitoring
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the implementation

## Integration Points
- Designed as a true bridge between iMessage and the JavaScript AMF core
- The V-8 under the hood (JavaScript) powers all formula calculations
- Maintains formula consistency: F = ((AI)(P^I) + c^(x*I))v and AIc + 0.1 = BMqs
- Created bi-directional communication between Swift and JavaScript

## Next Steps
- Integrate with existing database via JavaScript bridge
- Implement full agent handoff capabilities using AgentHandoff.js
- Create XCTest suite to verify buffer integrity across JavaScript calls
- Add advanced UI themes with quantum state visualization

This implementation follows the "thin wrapper" design pattern, serving as the narrow bridge between the iMessage platform and the JavaScript AMF engine.
