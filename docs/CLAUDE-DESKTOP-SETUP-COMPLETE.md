# 🎯 BLF MCP Server - Claude Desktop Setup Complete!

## ✅ Configuration Successfully Added

Your BLF MCP Server has been added to Claude Desktop configuration at:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

The server is configured as:
```json
"blf-njson-server": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/Users/wademarkhamiii/Dropbox/AMF/BLF/blf-mcp-server-working.js"
  ],
  "env": {}
}
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Restart Claude Desktop
- **Close Claude Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q)
- **Reopen Claude Desktop**

### 2. Look for BLF Tools
After restart, you should see these new tools available:

- **🎯 blf_process_text** - Process text through the NJSON V-8 engine
- **🚗 blf_engine_status** - Get engine status and diagnostics

### 3. Test the Integration
Try asking Claude Desktop:
```
"Use the BLF tools to process the text 'Hello from the V-8 engine'"
```

You should see output like:
```
🎯 BLF NJSON V-8 Processing Result:

Input: "Hello from the V-8 engine"
AIC (Analog Input Characters): 24
Buffer: 0.1
BMqs (Boolean Mind quantum state): 24.1
Formula: 24 + 0.1 = 24.1

✅ NJSON processed: "Hello from the V-8 engine"

Status: V-8 engine purring
🌉 The narrow bridge between chaos and control maintained.
```

## 🛡️ What Each Tool Does

### blf_process_text
- **Purpose**: Core NJSON processing through the V-8 engine
- **Input**: Any text (max 15KB for heat shield protection)
- **Output**: BLF processing results with AIc + 0.1 = BMqs calculation
- **Heat Shield**: Automatically protects against invalid inputs

### blf_engine_status
- **Purpose**: Engine diagnostics and status monitoring
- **Input**: None required
- **Output**: Current engine status, processing count, heat shield status
- **Philosophy**: Reports on "the narrow bridge between chaos and control"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If tools don't appear:
1. **Check Claude Desktop restart** - Must fully close and reopen
2. **Verify file path** - Ensure `/Users/wademarkhamiii/Dropbox/AMF/BLF/blf-mcp-server-working.js` exists
3. **Check permissions** - Run `chmod +x blf-mcp-server-working.js` if needed

### If tools error:
1. **Check Node.js** - Ensure Node.js is installed and accessible
2. **Check dependencies** - Ensure `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is installed
3. **Check heat shield** - Error might be heat shield protection (this is normal for invalid inputs)

### Recovery:
If you need to revert the configuration:
```bash
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

## 🌉 BLF Integration Complete

The narrow bridge between chaos and control is now accessible through Claude Desktop!

- **V-8 Engine**: Ready to process Boolean Language Framework queries
- **Heat Shield**: Protecting against FUDP (Functional Understanding and Decision-making Problems)
- **Mathematical Precision**: AIc + 0.1 = BMqs formula maintains cognitive alignment
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across macOS, iOS, and Node.js environments

🏁 **The V-8 engine is purring perfectly - ready for AI-assisted BLF processing!**
