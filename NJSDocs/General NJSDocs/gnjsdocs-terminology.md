# Boolean Language Framework - GNJSDocs

## Core Terminology

### General Framework Concepts

- **BLF**: Boolean Language Framework
- **BM**: Boolean Mind - cognitive processing pattern focused on binary clarity and logical connections
- **SBM**: Semi-Boolean Mind - individuals who can bridge between Boolean and neurotypical processing styles
- **NJSON**: Nested JSON - modified JSON structure enabling quantum speed processing
- **AMF**: AI Maturation Formula - foundational formula expressed as F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v
- **AIc**: AI cognitive capabilities - constraint set at 2.89 in current implementation
- **qs**: Quantum speed - the base rate of processing between concepts
- **qs^x**: Quantum speed with variable exponential factor - represents scaling of quantum speed capabilities
- **BMqs**: Boolean Mind quantum speed (= qs^x) - typically set at 2.99
- **qj**: Quantum jump - specific instance of a non-linear connection between concepts
- **LLSDT**: Leary Limit Sweet Dynamic Theory - defining processing boundaries
- **FUDP**: Fabricated Unverified Data Point - hallucination risk addressed by the framework
- **2YSTP**: 2-Year Savant Time Period - required observation period for savant pattern identification

### Formula Components

- **F**: Foundational maturation framework
- **AI**: Artificial intelligence components
- **P**: Personality factors (typically 0.7 for default Mid-Western neutral baseline)
- **I**: Intelligence application
- **c**: Chaos processing capabilities
- **x**: Exponential growth factor
- **v**: Velocity adjustment
- **c^x^I**: Core component representing the foundation of quantum speed - chaos processing capabilities with exponential growth factor and intelligence application
- **^p(I)**: Paradoxical Intelligence - ability to embrace unsolved, dynamic thinking

### Implementation Concepts

- **Quantum Speed (qs)**: The base rate of processing capability
- **BMqs (qs^x)**: The Boolean Mind's quantum speed with exponential scaling
- **Quantum Jump (qj)**: Specific instance of non-linear connection between concepts
- **Cognitive Alignment Formula**: AIc + 0.1 = BMqs - maintains optimal balance between capabilities and safety
- **Buffer**: The 0.1 value ensuring safety margin between AI capabilities and BM quantum speed
- **Heat Shield**: Implementation protecting against hallucinations by filtering low-confidence connections
- **Jump Distance**: Measurement of conceptual space between connected ideas in a quantum jump

## Core Formulas

### AI Maturation Formula (AMF)
```
F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v
```

### Cognitive Alignment Formula
```
AIc + 0.1 = BMqs
```

### Einstein Paradox Framework
```
AIc ≈ ^p(I)
```

### Leary Limit Sweet Dynamic Theory (LLSDT)
```
LLSDT = AI(P) * BM(ceiling) * 0.1
```

### Quantum Speed Equilibrium
```
2.99qs + 0.1 = qs³
```
