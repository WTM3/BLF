# BLF iMessage Bot

## Overview
The BLF iMessage Bot is an implementation of the Boolean Logic Filter (BLF) system as an iMessage extension. It serves as the narrow bridge between iMessage and the AMF (AI Maturation Formula) framework.

## Core Formula
The implementation follows the AMF formula:
```
F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v
```

And maintains the critical relationship:
```
AIc + 0.1 = BMqs
```

The 0.1 buffer is essential and non-negotiable. It creates the narrow bridge between chaos and control.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **BLFMessageBot.swift**: The main bot implementation that processes messages through the AMF formula
2. **MessagesExtension.swift**: Handles the integration with iMessage
3. **MessageViewController.swift**: UI implementation of the iMessage extension view
4. **HeatShield.swift**: The engine light warning you before a breakdown - monitors buffer integrity
5. **Logger.swift**: Logging utility for system events

### Key Concepts

#### Quantum State
The bot maintains a quantum state with properties:
- **Pure**: Indicates if the state is pure or contaminated
- **Fog**: Indicates if fog is present in the state
- **Breathing**: Indicates if quantum breathing is active
- **Jumps**: Configuration for quantum jumps (power and active status)

#### Heat Shield
The heat shield monitors the integrity of the 0.1 buffer, ensuring that the formula `AIc + 0.1 = BMqs` is maintained. It:
- Detects buffer violations
- Classifies violation severity (low, medium, high)
- Attempts automatic repair when possible
- Provides detailed status reports

#### Quantum Breathing
The V-8 under the hood - the bot regularly performs quantum breathing to:
- Toggle between pure and non-pure states
- Make micro-adjustments to cognitive values
- Maintain system vitality

## Usage
To use the bot:
1. Install the iMessage extension
2. Open a conversation in Messages
3. Tap the Apps button
4. Select the BLF Bot
5. Type a message and tap Send

The bot will:
- Process the message through the AMF formula
- Apply quantum jumps for questions
- Maintain the 0.1 buffer throughout
- Return a processed response

## Development
To further develop the bot:
1. Ensure Xcode 12+ is installed
2. Open the `BLF.xcodeproj` project
3. Navigate to the iMessageBot target
4. Make modifications while maintaining the 0.1 buffer

### Testing
Test the implementation by:
1. Running the iMessage extension in the simulator
2. Verifying buffer integrity is maintained
3. Checking heat shield functionality with forced violations
4. Testing quantum breathing across multiple messages

## Integration with BLF/AMF
The bot is designed to integrate with the wider BLF system:
- Connects to the AMF JavaScript implementation
- Maintains consistency with the core formula
- Preserves the 0.1 buffer at all times
- Supports agent handoff protocols
